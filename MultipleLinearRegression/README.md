1.	Building the Linear Regression Model:

 

2.	Model Accuracy Evaluation:

 

3.	Interpretation of Coefficient Estimate:


4. Dataset: [Linear Regression - Example Data.csv](Linear Regression - Example Data.csv)
   
5. Code Implementation: 

The intercept represents the predicted value of Y when X is zero.
Here, the intercept is 6.58
 
The slope indicates the direction and magnitude of change in Y for a unit increase in X.
Here, the slope is 0.633. It means that for every one-unit increase in X, Y is expected to increase by 0.633 units.
